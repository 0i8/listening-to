A simple discord rpc lastfm integration using pypresence.

Host your own instance because centralization is bad.


### Installation
1. Go to the [discord dev portal](https://discord.com/developers/) and create a new application. You will replace client_id in config.json with your application id.
2. Find your discord user token, there are plenty of guides on how to do so I will no go into details here. You will replace discord_token in config.json with your token.
    > Be warned as this is in the grey area of discord TOS
    
    
    > DO NOT SHARE YOUR TOKEN ANYWHERE AND DO NOT COMMIT IT TO GITHUB
3. Go to the [lastfm api page](https://www.last.fm/api) and register for an account.
